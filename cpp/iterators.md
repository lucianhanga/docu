### ostream iterators usage

```c++
ostream_iterator<int> output{ cout, " " };
std::copy(begin(vec), end(vec), output);
```
### common ranges 

`common ranges` are the ranges made using the container `.begin` `.end` container member functions (ranges generated by two iterators), not to be confused with the c++20 `ranges`.

### container iterators 

`begin()` - random access iterator pointing to the first element   
`front()` -  reference to the first element
same thing with
`end()` - random access iterator pointing after the last element
`back()` - reference to the last element

In the context of C++20 `ranges`, a sentinel is an object that represents when the end of the container has been reached. 

### .erase()

Normally `erase` destroys the objects that are erased from a container. However, erasing an element that is a pointer to a dynamically allocated object does **NOT** delete the object, potentially causing a memory leak. If the element is a `unique_ptr`, the `unique_ptr` would be destroyed and the dynamically allocated memory would be deleted.
