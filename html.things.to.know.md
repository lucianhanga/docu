#HTML - Things to Know

##```display: flex```

The ```display: flex``` property-value pair converts the body container into a ```flexbox``` and causes the body’s child elements to conform to the size of their content (and not span the width of the web page).
The ```align-items: flex-start``` property-value causes the flexbox container’s child elements to be aligned at the top.
