## What is Reinforcement Learning?

**Environment** - the AI will perform in ca certain environment.
**Agent** - It is the AI that will learn from the environment. 
**Action** - The agent will perform certain **actions** in the **environment**. 
**State** - The state of the agent in the environment which will be changed by the actions.
**Reward** - The reward is the **feedback** from the environment to the agent. It is a number that indicates how good the agent performed in the current state.

The agent will keep making actions in the environment and will learn from the reward. The goal is to **maximize** the reward.
By this the agent will learn the environment and will be able to perform better in the future.
