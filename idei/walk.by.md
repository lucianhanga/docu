# walkby


- bluetooth broadcast
- Unique ID is bluetooth MAC list (all the devices the user has)
- when app is started basic profile is loaded - NO PICTURE
- programm AI which matches profiles and gives probability of matching 
- free version just singals which 90% is detected with  one minute delay
  (of when the match just left the range)
- decide of a payment plan monthly/qartal/yearly/lifetime
- matching can be:
     - love partner
     - best buddy   (paying customers)
     - sex partner (over 18) (paying customers)
- when you detect a high match ... lets say over 75% see in the people profiles which is not specified
  and ask questions for the users to see if they would have had similar hobies.
 e.g. if  in the scenario above James wrote that "He likes walks arround lakes"  then when Andrea will 
 open her app next time the app will ask her what she thinks about "Walks arround lakes ... or lakes in general"

- the idea is to have people describing themselves rather than showing images/pictures
- from descriptions with the appropriate AIs we can make matches

A.D.s 

- Searching your partner, stop stareing at your computer, go out to a concert, have a dance in a club, walk in the city 
  give your partner a chance to Walkby

- Imagine city center, you  Walkby, the phone buzzes, you fell the rush, its happening. You just need to raise your eyes and search. 

-  our Walkby pictures. (the walkby picture it looks like an impresionist picture made by texts of different colors which contain the decription you made for yourself)
